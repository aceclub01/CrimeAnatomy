What is a Love Scam?
  A fraudulent scheme where scammers pose as romantic partners to manipulate victims into sending money or personal information.
  Often occurs on dating apps, social media, and messaging platforms.

Steps used by the scammers
    The love scam process can be broken down into stages:
    Initial Contact: Scammers create a fake profile and start engaging emotionally.
    Building Trust: They develop a bond, using personal stories and flattering the victim.
    Creating Urgency: They invent a crisis, like an emergency, leading to a money request.
    Withdrawal: After money is sent, the scammer disappears or creates more excuses.

Common Tactics Used
  Creating fake online profiles using stolen images.
  Establishing emotional connections quickly.
  Claiming emergencies to request financial assistance.
  Avoiding video calls or inperson meetings.

Red Flags to Watch For
  Rapid emotional attachment.
  Requests for money or financial help.
  Inconsistent stories or reluctance to meet.
  Pressuring victims to keep the relationship secret.
  Strangers with Fast Intimacy: Beware of sudden deep emotional connections, especially with people met online.
  Requests for Money: Scammers often fabricate urgent situations requiring money.
  Promises of Meeting Up: Scammers claim they are coming to meet you but always have an excuse.
  Too Much Personal Information: They avoid sharing details about themselves but want to know everything about you.
  Unverifiable Stories: Their stories may have inconsistencies or lack verifiable details.

Prevention Tips
  Verify identities through reverse image searches.
  Be skeptical of online romantic interests who never meet in person.
  Never send money to someone you havenâ€™t met.
  Report suspicious profiles to authorities.
